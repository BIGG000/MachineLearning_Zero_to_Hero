# MachineLearning Zero to Hero

## Machine learning   
## 30 DAYS OF HANDS_ON PRACTICE...( ZERO TO HERO )

It's a bootcamp of Machine Learning in which we practice all the types and algortihms.

## Machine Learning
  Machine learning is the practice of teaching a computer to learn. The concept uses pattern recognition, as well as other forms of predictive algorithms, to make judgments on incoming data. This field is closely related to artificial intelligence and computational statistics.
  
 ## Machine Learning Libraries Python
 There are alot of ML libaries but some are those which used alot for the development.
  * TensorFlow
  * Keras
  * Scikit
  * Pytorch
  
  ## Machine Learning Model Pipeline 
 It a very simple and easy thing to do for any Probelm to solve in ML.
  ### Step - 01:
   * Determine the Objective of the Problem
   * Data Gathering
   * Data Preprocessing
   * Data Anaylization
   * Data Visualization
   * Building a Machine Learning Model
   * Model Evaluation & Optimization
   * Predictions
   * Building a Model Package/ Deploy on the need
   
   ## Here the Topics for Days   
   ## Data PreProscessing ( Day 01 )
